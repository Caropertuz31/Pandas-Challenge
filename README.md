## School Distric Analysis

In this project for the Analysis of the School distric was generete a script code in the Jupyter notebook program to Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, this script includes the following information:

### District Summary:
- Total number of unique schools.
- Total students.
- Total budget.
- Average math score.
- Average reading score.
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math).
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading).
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math and reading).

### School Summary:
- School name.
- School type.
- Total students.
- Total school budget.
- Per student budget.
- Average math score.
- Average reading score.
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math).
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading).
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math and reading).

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):
this script Sort the schools by the (% Overall Passing) in descending order.
### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing): 
this script Sort the schools by the (% Overall Passing) in ascending order.
### Math Scores by Grade:
this script creates a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
### Reading Scores by Grade:
this script creates a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
### Scores by School Spending: 
this script breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
### Scores by School Size: 
this script breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
### Scores by School Type.
